# Food Waste Analysis and Prevention

## Overview
This project analyzes food consumption and wastage patterns at events to help reduce food waste and prevent potential shortages. The analysis identifies key factors driving waste and provides actionable insights for better food planning.

## About the Data
The dataset contains **1782 records** and **11 variables** from various events where food was provided:

- **Type of Food:** Meat, fruits, baked goods, dairy, etc. (categorical)  
- **Number of Guests:** Attendees at the event (numeric)  
- **Event Type:** Corporate, wedding, birthday, social gatherings (categorical)  
- **Quantity of Food:** Amount ordered for an event (numeric)  
- **Storage Conditions:** Room temperature or refrigerated (categorical)  
- **Purchase History:** Regular or occasional customer (categorical)  
- **Seasonality:** Winter, summer, or all seasons (categorical)  
- **Preparation Method:** Sit-down dinner, buffet, or finger food (categorical)  
- **Geographical Location:** Suburban, urban, or rural (categorical)  
- **Pricing:** Low, moderate, high (categorical)  
- **Wasted Food Amount:** Total food thrown away (numeric)  

## Goal of the Analysis
- Reduce food wastage at events  
- Prevent potential food shortages  
- Identify main drivers of waste to help the company plan better  

## Key Insights
- **Event Types & Locations:** Most events are corporate gatherings in suburban areas  
- **High-Risk Food Types:** Fruits and baked goods are wasted most frequently  
- **Preparation Method Impact:** Sit-down dinners are most common; buffets are less frequent  
- **Storage & Season:** Waste percentages are similar regardless of refrigeration or season  
- **Guest Numbers vs Food Prepared:** More guests strongly correlate with more food prepared, but waste per person is not strongly affected  
- **Seasonal Waste Patterns:** Social gatherings show slightly higher waste in summer and winter  

## Research Questions Addressed
1. **Most common event type and location?**  
   - Corporate events in suburban areas  
2. **Which food types are most wasted?**  
   - Fruits and baked goods  
3. **Impact of food serving method?**  
   - Sit-down dinners are most common; preparation style affects waste control  
4. **Effect of storage and season?**  
   - Little impact; average waste remains similar  
5. **Number of events by storage conditions?**  
   - More events involve food stored at room temperature  
6. **Relationship between guests and food prepared?**  
   - Strong positive correlation  
7. **Seasonal variation in waste by event type?**  
   - Minor variations; social gatherings slightly higher in summer and winter  

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the company’s food wastage patterns and suggests:  
- Focus on corporate events in suburban areas  
- Prioritize better planning for fruits and baked goods  
- Adjust food quantities based on guest numbers rather than storage conditions  

Implementing these insights can help reduce waste and ensure sufficient food at all events.
